Build strace from git repository
================================
If you use a GIT version of strace source code, there will be some files missing
that are needed to build strace.  Some of these files are generated by tools
from the GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake packages.

Note: rather than running `autoreconf` directly, please invoke `./bootstrap`
script and follow the instructions given in [INSTALL](README-configure) file for further
building and installation.
