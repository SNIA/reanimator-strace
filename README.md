strace - the linux syscall tracer
=================================

This is [strace](https://strace.io) -- a diagnostic, debugging and instructional userspace utility with a traditional command-line interface for Linux.  It is used to monitor and tamper with interactions between processes and the Linux kernel, which include system calls, signal deliveries, and changes of process state.  The operation of strace is made possible by the kernel feature known as [ptrace](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html).
